## How to Solve Programming Problems

### Common mistakes

- The most common mistake is try to start writing code as soon as possible.
- Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration. 
**Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.**

### Solving Problems

#### A simple set of steps

1. **Read the problem completely twice.**
-  read the problem 3 or 4 times.
- make sure you completely understand the problem. 

2. **Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.**
- It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate.
-  solve the problem with at least three different inputs to make sure you really understand your solution 
- use a Mathematical Induction approach if possible .

3. **Optimize the manual steps.**
- What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

4. **Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.**
- What we want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.

5. **Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.**
- All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.

6. **Optimize the real code.**
- This is a good place to make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names. 

## Act like you make $1000/hr

Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You’ll Become 100x More Productive.
**How you value your time is how you value your life**

**What you think is what you become**.

- If you think your time is worth a few bucks an hour, that you’ll begin to act like it. You’ll find yourself saying “yes” to meaningless, pointless obligations.

But if, in your heart, you know your time is valuable…
People will recognize that.
People will respect that.
People will treat you differently.

- “The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.” -Warren Buffet
You probably need to say “no” more.

- Living in frenzy is a sign we’ve squandered too much

## How to think like a programmer

“Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.”

 ### what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

 - Here are the steps:

1. Understand
2. Plan
3. Divide
4. Stuck?
5. Practice
