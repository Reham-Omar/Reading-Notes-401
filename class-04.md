# What is Data Modelling?
Data modelling is the process of taking unstructured real-world data and putting it into a structured, logical data model. 

# Mongoose

- Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. 
- It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

- Enter “Mongoose”, and “ORM” for the Mongo database.
- Mongoose is a Node library that makes it easy for developers to not only interface with a Mongo database, but reliably structure the data (without losing flexibility).

**Mongoose provides 2 essential things to make this easy for you:**

1. Schema - the rules to structure your data
2. CRUD methods (on steroids) to work easier with the data

## Cloud Databases

**MLab**- remotely hosted mongoDB systems. Easily setup a free database .
**Atlas**- Cloud based, highly scalable Mongo DB.
**DynamoDB**- AWS NoSQL Database. Very highly scalable, Also provides a ‘mongoose’-like ORM called ‘dynamoose’

# NoSQL

- “NoSQL” database is based on document storage.
- Document database puts all of that information into One Record that you can retrieve very quickly, having all of the data you want at your disposal.

- NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, which means that they can handle increased traffic simply by adding more servers to the database. NoSQL databases have the ability to become larger and much more powerful, making them the preferred choice for large or constantly evolving data sets
