# Component Based UI

## React

- It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
- React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

## What is JSX?
- JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
- JSX is not JavaScript nor HTML.
- JSX is a XML syntax extension to JavaScript that also comes with the full power of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).
- Just like HTML, JSX tags can have a tag names, attributes, and children. If an attribute is wrapped in curly braces, the value is a JavaScript expression.

*Example*
`const element = <h1>Hello World!</h1>`

## SASS (Syntactically awesome style sheets)
- It is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
- It enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more.
- It also helps to keep things organised and allows you to create style sheets faster.
- Sass is compatible with all versions of CSS


## How Does Sass Work?
A browser does not understand Sass code. Therefore, you will need a Sass pre-processor to convert Sass code into standard CSS.
This process is called transpiling. So, you need to give a transpiler (some kind of program) some Sass code and then get some CSS code back.
- Sass files has the ".scss" file extension.
